### Task Management

Keep track of everything you need to do with our task management system. You can create tasks with different priority levels (Low, Medium, High) and set due dates to ensure nothing falls through the cracks. Mark tasks as complete when you finish them, or delete them if they're no longer relevant. The system helps you visualize what needs your attention most urgently.

### Pomodoro Timer

Stay focused with the built-in Pomodoro timer. You can customize your work and break intervals to match your preferences, and the timer will automatically transition between work sessions and breaks. Audio notifications alert you when it's time to switch, and the system tracks how many sessions you've completed. This technique helps maintain concentration while preventing burnout.

### Flashcards

Flashcards are perfect for memorizing facts, definitions, and concepts. Create custom decks for different subjects or topics, then add cards with questions on one side and answers on the other. When reviewing, simply click to flip between question and answer. You can shuffle the deck for varied practice or go through cards in order. It's a simple but effective way to reinforce your learning.
